# Countercurrent-Separations

Introduces students to counter-current extractions as a method for separating two solutes from each other. The distribution ratios for each solute are set by the user and the progress of the extraction viewed manually by examining the separation after a user-selected number of steps. The simulation is limited to 100 tubes and 100 steps.
