# Countercurrent-Separations
 
A one-page application in more traditional textual form that models a countercurrent separation of two analytes. The distribution ratios for each analyte are set by the user and the progress of the separation viewed by manually stepping through the separation, or as an animation.  

To run locally, install the package Shiny (if not already installed), and enter the following two lines into the console:

library(shiny)
