<p>On the previous tab we visualized the progress of a countercurrent
extraction as both a numerical value and as the shading of a square that
represents a tube. Although effective, this visualization is limited by
the space needed to display steps and tubes, and is limited to a single
solute.</p>
<p>The figure on the right is a more compact way to display a
countercurrent extraction—in this case for two solutes—using up to <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> tubes and <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> steps. Sliders define the fraction of
each solute, <span class="math inline">\(p_a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_b\)</span>, that moves from the stationary phase
into the mobile phase. A third slider displays the contents of each tube
after the designated number of steps; a play button on this slider
animates the separation.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.</strong> The default settings are <span class="math inline">\(p_a = 0.83\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_b = 0.33\)</span> for solute B, and 50 steps.
Adjust the slider for steps to 10 and describe the distribution of each
solute giving attention to position, shape, height, and width. Repeat
for steps of <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(30\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(70\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(80\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(90\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>. Is there a relationship between
<em>p</em>, the number of steps, and the position of the solute’s
distribution?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Using the default conditions of <span class="math inline">\(p_a = 0.83\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_b = 0.33\)</span>, determine the fewest number
of steps that will allow for an effective separation of the two solutes.
Give some thought to how you will define an effective separation.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Use the slider for solute A and
determine the largest value of <span class="math inline">\(p_a\)</span>
that will allow for an effective separation of the two solutes after
<span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> steps if <span class="math inline">\(p_b = 0.33\)</span> for solute B. Repeat for
solute B, determining the smallest value of <span class="math inline">\(p_b\)</span> that will allow for an effective
separation of the two solutes after <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> steps if <span class="math inline">\(p_a = 0.83\)</span> for solute A.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Given the limitation of <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> steps, is it possible to achieve a
complete separation of two solutes if one solute has <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.2\)</span> and the other solute has <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.25\)</span>?</p>
