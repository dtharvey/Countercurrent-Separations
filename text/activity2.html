<p>On the previous tab you considered one way to visualize a solvent’s
movement in a countercurrent extraction using a figure that shows the
fraction of solute in each tube at each step as both a numerical value
and as the shading of a square that represents a tube. Although
effective, this visualization is limited by the space needed to display
steps and tubes, and is limited to a single solute.</p>
<p>The figure on the right is a more compact way to display a
countercurrent extraction, in this case for two solutes, A and B, using
up to 100 tubes and 100 steps. Sliders are used to define the fraction
of each solute, <span class="math inline">\(p_a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_b\)</span>, that moves from the stationary phase
into the mobile phase. A third slider displays the contents of each tube
after the designated number of steps; a play button on this slider
animates the separation.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.</strong> The default settings are <span class="math inline">\(p_a = 0.83\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_b = 0.33\)</span> for solute B, and 50 steps.
Adjust the slider for steps to 10 and describe the distribution of each
solute giving attention to position, shape, height, and width. Repeat
for steps of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100. Is there a
relationship between <em>p</em>, the number of steps, and the position
of the solute’s distribution?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Using the default conditions of <span class="math inline">\(p_a = 0.83\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_b = 0.33\)</span>, determine the fewest number
of steps that will allow for an effective separation of the two solutes.
Give some thought to how you will define an effective separation.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Use the slider for solute A and
determine the largest value of <span class="math inline">\(p_a\)</span>
that will allow for an effective separation of the two solutes after 100
steps if <span class="math inline">\(p_b = 0.33\)</span> for solute B.
Repeat for solute B, determining the smallest value of <span class="math inline">\(p_b\)</span> that will allow for an effective
separation of the two solutes after 100 steps if <span class="math inline">\(p_a = 0.83\)</span> for solute A.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Given our limitation of 100 steps, is it
possible to achieve a complete separation of two solutes if one solute
has <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.2\)</span> and the other solute
has <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.25\)</span>?</p>
