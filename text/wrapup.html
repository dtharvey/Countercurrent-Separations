<h4>Is a Countercurrent Extraction Practical?</h4>
<p>The simulation of a CCE separation in this module is limited to 100
tubes and steps, which is not enough to separate mixtures of solutes
when their values of <em>p</em> are similar to each other. Given a
sufficient number of tubes and steps, however, we can separate any
mixture of two (or more) solutes. As a method for separating solutes, a
countercurrent extraction is impractical. It is a useful model, however,
for a chromatographic separation in which a stationary phase remains
within a column and a mobile phase passes through the column.</p>

<h4>Another Visualization of CCE Separation</h4>
<p>The figure on the right provides another view of a countercurrent
extraction in the form of a <span class="math inline">\(3 \times
3\)</span> grid of the separation of solute A (<span class="math inline">\(p_a = 0.83)\)</span> from solute B (<span class="math inline">\(p_b = 0.330\)</span> at nine different moments in
the separation. Unlike the animated CCE experiment on the previous tab,
the <em>y</em>-axis scale here is held constant, which makes it easier
to appreciate how the time a solute spends moving through the system
affects its position, shape, height, and width.</p>

<h4>Simulating a Countercurrent Extraction</h4>
<p>The fraction of a solute that moves from the stationary phase into
the mobile phase is <em>p</em> and the fraction that remains in the
stationary phase is <em>q</em>, where <span class="math inline">\(p + q
= 1\)</span>. This should remind you of the odds associated with
flipping a coin 10 times and having heads come up seven times; indeed,
both follow a binomial distribution. The fraction of solute in tube
<em>t</em> at the end of <em>s</em> steps, <span class="math inline">\(f(t,s)\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(t,s) = \frac{s!}{(s-t)!t!} \times
p^{t} \times q^{s-t}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(s \ge t\)</span>. This binomial
equation was used to simulate the countercurrent extractions in this
module.</p>
<p>A binomial distribution has a well-defined mean and standard
deviation. After <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> steps, the mean
of a solute’s distribution is <span class="math inline">\(\mu =
np\)</span>, and its standard deviation is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = \sqrt{n p q}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> have their usual meanings. Try this.
Return to the previous tab and model the countercurrent extraction of a
mixture of solute A, with <span class="math inline">\(p_a =
0.2\)</span>, and solute B with <span class="math inline">\(p =
0.8\)</span>, and estimate, after 100 steps, the mean and standard
deviation for each solute’s distribution. Then, calculate their expected
means and standard deviations using a binomial distribution. How do your
results compare to each other?</p>

<h4>Comparing a CCE to a LLE</h4>
<p>If you have worked on the module on liquid-liquid extractions, then
you may have asked yourself why this module uses <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, the distribution ratio. We know from
the LLE module that for any step—and in the LLE module we assigned this
to the aqueous phase—the fraction of solute not extracted is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(Q_{aq})_1 = \frac{(\text{mol
aq})_1}{(\text{mol aq})_0} = \frac{V_{aq}}{DV_{org} +
V_{aq}}\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(V_{aq} = V_{org}\)</span>, which is
the case for CCE, this simplifies to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(Q_{aq})_1 = q =
\frac{1}{D+1}\]</span></p>
