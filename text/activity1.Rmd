The table below summarizes the movement of the solute between the two phases as outlined in the introduction. Each row is a step and each column gives the solute's relative concentration in each tube at the end of the step.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
col_one = c(1,"q","q<sup>2</sup>","???")
col_two = c("—", "p","2pq","???")
col_three = c("—","—","p<sup>2</sup>","???")
col_four = c("???","???","???","???")
df = data.frame(col_one,col_two,col_three, col_four)
colnames(df) = c("tube 0", "tube 1", "tube 2", "tube 3")
rownames(df) = c("step 0", "step 1", "step 2", "step 3")
df %>%
  kbl(escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

The figure to the right shows the relative amount of solute in the first six tubes at the end of the first six steps. The fraction of solute extracted from the stationary phase into the mobile phase, *p*, is set by the slider. The fraction of solute in each tube at each step is shown both quantitatively and qualitatively: as a number between $0$ and $1$, and by the shading of the blue color that represents the solute.

**Exercise 1.** Examine the entries in the table and identify patterns you see in the rows and/or columns. Predict the entries for column 3 and for row 3 (which are listed as ???). Use the slider to verify your answers.

**Exercise 2.** Use the slider to explore how the value of *p* affects a solute's movement with the mobile phase. What do you see when $p = 0$? What do you see when $p = 1$? What is the largest value of *p* for which no solute reaches tube 5? What is the smallest value of *p* for which some solute remains in tube $0$ at the end of step 5?
