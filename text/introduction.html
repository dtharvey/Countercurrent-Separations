<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem}\)</span>One limitation
of a liquid-liquid extraction is that it is difficult to separate
solutes with similar chemical properties. Another approach is the
countercurrent extraction illustrated on the right.</p>
<div id="step-0-the-intial-set-up" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 0: The Intial Set-Up</h4>
<p>Imagine a line of tubes labeled from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, each with the same volume of solvent;
tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> also contains a solute. To
tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> we add a second solvent.
Because the solvents are immiscible, one is layered below the other. We
call these the lower phase and the upper phase. At this point—which is
step <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>—the solute is only in the
lower phase of tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>; thus, its
fraction in the lower phase is 1 and its fraction in tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is 1.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-1-shake-extract-and-shift" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 1: Shake, Extract, and Shift</h4>
<p>Next we shake tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and extract
a fraction <em>p</em> of the solute into the upper phase and retain a
fraction <span class="math inline">\(q = 1 - p\)</span> of the solute in
the lower phase. We then shift the upper phase from tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to tube 1 and add a fresh portion of
upper phase to tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. At the end
of step 1, tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> contains a
fraction <em>q</em> of the solute and tube 1 contains a fraction
<em>p</em> of the solute.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-repeat-shake-extract-and-shift" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 2: Repeat Shake, Extract, and Shift</h4>
<p>The process of shaking, extracting, and shifting continues. At the
end of step 2, tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> contains a
fraction <span class="math inline">\(q^2\)</span> of the solute, tube 1
contains a fraction <span class="math inline">\(2pq\)</span> of the
solute, and tube 2 contains a fraction <span class="math inline">\(p^2\)</span> of the solute.</p>
</div>
<div id="stationary-and-mobile-phases" class="section level4">
<h4>Stationary and Mobile Phases</h4>
<p>Did you notice that our description of the upper phase is active in
that we transfer the solvent down the line of tubes. Our description of
the lower phase is passive in that the solvent in the lower phase always
remains in its original tube. The lower phase is stationary and the
upper phase is mobile, terms we will encounter in modules on
chromatographic methods of analysis.</p>
