<p>One limitation of a liquid-liquid extraction is that it is difficult
to separate solutes with similar chemical properties as they are likely
to have similar solubilities in the two liquid phases. Another approach
is a countercurrent extraction (CCE), the details of which are
illustrated in the figure on the right.</p>

<h4>Step 0: The Intial Set-Up</h4>
<p>Imagine a line of tubes labeled from tube 0 to tube <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Each tube holds an equal volume of a
solvent that contains a solute we want to extract into a different
solvent. We add a portion of the second solvent to tube 0. Because the
solvents are immiscible, one is layered below the other; we call these
solvents the lower phase and the upper phase. At this point—which we
call step 0—the solute is present only in the lower phase of tube 0;
thus, its fraction in the lower phase is 1 and its fraction in tube 0 is
1. This is the state of the system at the top of the figure.</p>

<div id="step-1-shake-extract-and-shift" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 1: Shake, Extract, and Shift</h4>
<p>Next we shake tube 0 and extract a fraction <em>p</em> of the solute
into the upper phase and retain a fraction <span class="math inline">\(q
= 1 - p\)</span> of the solute in the lower phase. We then transfer, or
shift, the upper phase from tube 0 to tube 1 and add a fresh portion of
the upper phase to tube 0. At the end of step 1, tube 0 contains a
fraction <em>q</em> of the solute and tube 1 contains a fraction
<em>p</em> of the solute. This is the state of the system at the middle
of the figure.</p>

<div id="step-2-repeat-shake-extract-and-shift" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 2: Repeat Shake, Extract, and Shift</h4>
<p>This process of extracting the solute between the lower phase and the
upper phase, and shifting the upper phase down the line of tubes
continues. At the end of step , tube 0 contains a fraction <span class="math inline">\(q^2\)</span> of the solute, tube 1 contains a
fraction <span class="math inline">\(2pq\)</span> of the solute, and
tube 2 contains a fraction <span class="math inline">\(p^2\)</span> of
the solute. This is the state of the system at the bottom of the
figure.</p>

<h4>Stationary and Mobile Phases</h4>
<p>Did you notice the difference in how we described the two phases? Our
description of the upper phase is active in that we transfer the solvent
down the line of tubes. Our description of the lower phase, however, is
passive in that the solvent in the lower phase always remains in its
original tube. The lower phase is stationary and the upper phase is
mobile, terms we will encounter in modules on chromatographic methods of
analysis.</p>
