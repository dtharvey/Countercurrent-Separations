<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem}\)</span>One limitation
of a liquid-liquid extraction is that it is difficult to separate
solutes with similar chemical properties. Another approach is the
countercurrent extraction illustrated on the right.</p>
<div id="step-0-the-intial-set-up" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 0: The Intial Set-Up</h4>
<p>Imagine a line of tubes labeled from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Each has the same volume of a solvent
and the tube labeled <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> also
contains a solute. To tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> we add
a second solvent. Because the solvents are immiscible, one is layered
below the other. We call these the lower phase and the upper phase. At
this point—which is step <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>—the
solute is only in the lower phase of tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>; thus, its fraction in the lower phase
is 1 and its fraction in tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is
1. This is the state of the system at the top of the figure.</p>

<div id="step-1-shake-extract-and-shift" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 1: Shake, Extract, and Shift</h4>
<p>Next we shake tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and extract
a fraction <em>p</em> of the solute into the upper phase and retain a
fraction <span class="math inline">\(q = 1 - p\)</span> of the solute in
the lower phase. We then transfer, or shift, the upper phase from tube
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to tube 1 and add a fresh portion
of the upper phase to tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. At
the end of step 1, tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> contains
a fraction <em>q</em> of the solute and tube 1 contains a fraction
<em>p</em> of the solute. This is the state of the system at the middle
of the figure.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-repeat-shake-extract-and-shift" class="section level4">
<h4>Step 2: Repeat Shake, Extract, and Shift</h4>
<p>This process of extracting the solute between the lower phase and the
upper phase, and shifting the upper phase down the line of tubes
continues. At the end of step 2, tube <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> contains a fraction <span class="math inline">\(q^2\)</span> of the solute, tube 1 contains a
fraction <span class="math inline">\(2pq\)</span> of the solute, and
tube 2 contains a fraction <span class="math inline">\(p^2\)</span> of
the solute. This is the state of the system at the bottom of the
figure.</p>
</div>
<div id="stationary-and-mobile-phases" class="section level4">
<h4>Stationary and Mobile Phases</h4>
<p>Did you notice that our description of the upper phase is active in
that we transfer the solvent down the line of tubes. Our description of
the lower phase, however, is passive in that the solvent in the lower
phase always remains in its original tube. The lower phase is stationary
and the upper phase is mobile, terms we will encounter in modules on
chromatographic methods of analysis.</p>
